# Lab 1: Connection of Network Devices Using Ethernet

## Preparation of Ethernet Cable with RJ45 Connectors

## Objective
The objective of this lab is to prepare Ethernet cables using RJ45 connectors, understand straight-through and crossover cables, and test the prepared cables using a cable tester to ensure proper connectivity.

## Materials Required
- Ethernet cable (Cat5e or Cat6)
- RJ45 connectors
- Crimping tool
- Wire stripper
- Cable tester

## Theory
Ethernet cables are used to connect network devices such as computers, switches, and routers. RJ45 connectors are attached to the ends of Ethernet cables for communication. Straight-through cables are used to connect different types of devices, while crossover cables are used to connect similar devices. The T568A and T568B standards define the arrangement of wires inside the RJ45 connector.

## Procedure

### Type 1: Straight-through Cable
1. Cut the Ethernet cable to the desired length.
2. Strip about 1 inch of the outer jacket from both ends of the cable using a wire stripper.
3. Untwist the wire pairs and arrange them according to the **T568B wiring standard**:
   - Pin 1: White/Orange  
   - Pin 2: Orange  
   - Pin 3: White/Green  
   - Pin 4: Blue  
   - Pin 5: White/Blue  
   - Pin 6: Green  
   - Pin 7: White/Brown  
   - Pin 8: Brown  
4. Trim the wires so they are of equal length.
5. Insert the wires into the RJ45 connector carefully.
6. Use the crimping tool to secure the connector.
7. Repeat the above steps for the other end of the cable.
8. Test the cable using a cable tester.

### Type 2: Crossover Cable
1. Follow steps 1–4 of the straight-through cable procedure.
2. Arrange one end of the cable according to the **T568A wiring standard**:
   - Pin 1: White/Green  
   - Pin 2: Green  
   - Pin 3: White/Orange  
   - Pin 4: Blue  
   - Pin 5: White/Blue  
   - Pin 6: Orange  
   - Pin 7: White/Brown  
   - Pin 8: Brown  
3. Arrange the other end according to the **T568B wiring standard**.
4. Trim the wires evenly.
5. Insert the wires into the RJ45 connectors.
6. Crimp both ends using the crimping tool.
7. Test the cable using a cable tester.

## Connection Testing Using Cable Tester
1. Connect one end of the cable to the transmitter unit of the cable tester.
2. Connect the other end to the receiver unit.
3. Turn on the tester and observe the LED indicators.

- **Straight-through cable**: Pins 1–8 show continuity in the same order.
- **Crossover cable**: Pins are crossed (1–3, 2–6, 3–1, 6–2).


## Result
The Ethernet straight-through and crossover cables were successfully prepared using RJ45 connectors. Cable testing confirmed that all wire connections were correct and there were no faults in the cables.

## Conclusion
In this lab, we learned how to prepare Ethernet cables using RJ45 connectors and understood the wiring standards T568A and T568B. We also learned the practical difference between straight-through and crossover cables. Proper crimping and correct wire arrangement are essential for reliable network communication. The cable tester helped verify the correctness of the connections.
